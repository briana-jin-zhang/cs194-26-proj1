# Images of the Russian Empire: Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection
In the 1900s, Prokudin-Gorskii gained permission by the tzar to take pictures throughout the vast 
Russian empire. He recorded three exposures of every scene on glass panes using red, green, and blue filters.
This project seeks to reproduce the true color images using image alignment techniques.
